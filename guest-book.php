                                    Must place to stay if visiting munnar. It is 2-3 hr drive uphill from munnar.
                                    Along the way, the tea gardens and the atmosphere and the scenic add to the beauty. The cost little expensive but absolutely worth it Stayed May 2015, travelled as a couple."</p>

								<p>"Approach will test your patience.
                                    Close house reminds of british era.
                                    Mansion cottage is spacious and having big conference hall and royal balcony looking at the estate.
                                    Spacious garden and serene beauty.
                                    Ambiance is complimenting.

								<p>"Firstly, I would like to thank the Camp Noel team for making our stay memorable. We were a group of 8. Each one of us has only good things to talk about this property. Right from the welcome we received until the time we checked out. The food served at the restaurant was delicious, the room service requests were prompt. The rooms were well maintained and most importantly, spacious. Undoubtedly, one of the best located properties surrounded by lush mountains and breath taking scenery. Overall, a very memorable and satisfying stay at Camp Noel. I would recommend Camp Noel to everyone of you who are planning a visit to this hill station."</p>

								<p>"The best place to stay in munnar (not considering distance from the city). The surrounding was mind blowing, the location is perfect but bit far from the city. But the view was breath taking. The cottages are well developed and kept well. The staff was as friendly as anybody can be. Most importantly Ranjani and anu. The chef was also very friendly and cooperative also considering his cooking skills mind blowing. Thought best place to go if you want to relax for couple of days and just chill."</p>
